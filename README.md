# Learn OpenGL
![logo](./glLogo.jpg)  

This is where I am going to be putting my progress with learning the OpenGL graphics api.
Mainly by following the tutorial series presented at [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/)

NOTE! This project uses GLFW and Glad. You will need to do the following if you decide to clone this down:
  
- Download GLFW 64 bit
- Compile it using CMake and the IDE of your choice.
- Link GLFW to the source directory
- [Download](https://glad.dav1d.de/) Glad and add the library and include folders to your project.
- Put Glad.c in the res folder from root

I recommend just following the detailed instructions found [here!](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window)
